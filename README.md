# PCA-for-IFRS9-forward-looking-modelling
The IFRS 9 standard requires that the ECL model accommodates the influence of the current and the forecasted macroeconomic conditions on credit loss. This enables a determination of forward-looking estimates on impairments.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) captures variability in data by data by transforming the original variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated principal components.
After reducing the data dimensionality, the selected principal components typically
serve as inputs for the regression model.
